#Calculator - by Anushka S. Chalakal  
This is a simple project I conceived of and created from scratch using HTML, CSS and Javascript. While I referred to other calculators to see how design and functions were generally handled, the final result is my own. This is the first such project I have undertaken as I study web development.

What the calculator can do:  
1. Carry out simple mathematical functions - addition, subtraction, multiplication and division - that includes decimal points.
2. Clear output based on whether "C" or "CE" is pressed. 
3. Start a new calculation if a number is pressed after one calculation is complete. 
4. Continue the old calculation if an operator is pressed after one calculation is complete. 

What it cannot do:
1. Respond to number key presses - coming in a future version.
2. Carry out brackets and percentage based calculation - forthcoming version. 

Thank you for checking out my work.
